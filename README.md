Data Collection and Preparation:
Obtain the sales data from Madhav Ecommerce. This could be in the form of CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or connecting directly to a database if available.
Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and relevant for analysis. Perform any necessary data cleaning and transformation using Power BI's built-in tools or Power Query Editor.
Import Data into Power BI:

Open Power BI Desktop.
Navigate to the "Home" tab and select "Get Data."
Choose the appropriate data source (e.g., Excel, CSV, SQL Server, etc.) and import the sales data into Power BI.
Data Modeling:

Once the data is imported, you'll typically create a data model in Power BI. This involves defining relationships between different tables if there are multiple data sources, creating calculated columns, and measures.
Creating Visualizations:

Use Power BI's visualization tools to create various charts, graphs, and tables to analyze sales data. Common visualizations might include:
Sales trends over time (line chart or area chart).
Sales by product category (bar chart or pie chart).
Geographic distribution of sales (map visualization).
Sales performance of individual products or product lines (matrix or table visualization).
Profit margins and revenue analysis.
